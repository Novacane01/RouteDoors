﻿Among runners and bikers, there is a universal demand for easily generated routes of a set distance. We described our project to two sponsors last night and one of them described his shared frustration with having to trace out routes in google maps before his runs.


(((Runners like this sponsor can only manually trace routes or rely on experience to make their own routes.)))


Our project generates a random closed loop path of a desired distance.


Here you can see that it takes a location, which can be set as your current location, and a desired distance. 


The website sends a request to a python function which is a google cloud function.


This python function first uses the Google geocode API to determine the longitude and latitude of the given location.


It then takes the distance and finds three other points that complete a random rectangle of a perimeter of that distance.


1. Find length of each path by dividing total length of perimeter by number of points that you want to have
2. Find individual routes to the four corners of the rectangle
3. While loop is kinda like steering algorithm
4. Have an output that you want to reach and given position of node, make small increments toward desired output until it reaches something that satisfies desired output
5. Takes direction to point and shifts it in the opposite way until the distance is in the desired range
   1. Determined by perimeter divided by number of points


We put the python code 




Our app is for the dreamer who wants to start running, but hesitates because they don’t know where to go. It’s for the dog-walker who wants to take their dog through exciting new sights and smells everyday. It’s for the millennial who just moved for their job and seeks adventure in an unfamiliar city. It’s for every runner who’s ready to break free from their regular routes.
